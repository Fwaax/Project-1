# Project-1
My first project in Full-Stack (Student)
For this project I had to to make a main site that held 6 projects total of 13 pages (1 for main 1 for each projects 6 projects in total and another 6 pages for landing page for the project
I mainly used HTML and CSS , bit of SASS and Bootstrap
Project 5 and 6 might be bit lacking because I had to get stuff from top of my head and I couldn't think of anything 
But I tried (they might be bit too small for a project)
Projects 1 ~ 4 I was assgined to use a template they provided me to try and make the exact same project
I learned alot of new stuff with this project can't wait to learn more 

Code Features:
This small site talks bit about me and shows how what project I've made in the gallery section
Most of the features work execpt the footer where I need to put in my location phone-number etc
